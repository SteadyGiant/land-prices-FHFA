# land-prices

Visualizing changes in land prices in New Jersey, using data from the Federal Housing Finance
Agency. I tweeted about this project
[here](https://twitter.com/TheRealEveret/status/1081025271392862208). More states might be coming soon.

# Data

Data on county-level land prices come from the Federal Housing Finance Agency,
and can be downloaded directly
[here](https://www.fhfa.gov/PolicyProgramsResearch/Research/PaperDocuments/Land-Prices_DLOS_2019-January.xlsx)
(Warning: .xlsx). There is also a ZIP code-level dataset within that Excel
workbook (Note: Actual ZIP codes, not ZCTAs). Maybe one day I'll muster the 
energy required to make a ZIP code-level map. Until then, any enterprising
person reading this is welcome to beat me to it.

I calculated "% Change in Land Prices 2012-17" for each county as follows:

> (L_2017 / L_2012) * 100

Where L_2017 is county-level aggregate land price per acre in 2017, and L_2012 
is the same for 2012.

The dataset which includes my calculations, and which was used to generated all
graphics in this project, is in `data/base/Land-Prices_DLOS_2019-January.xlsx`.
Any errors in this dataset or my code are solely mine.

### Universe

Map shows county-level % changes in land price per acre, only on land that lies
under single-family homes.
